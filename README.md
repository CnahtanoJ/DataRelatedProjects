# DataProjects

This repository contains some of my old projects during my university years and internship, and other personal projects. Some, if not all of them may not be perfect, but they are pretty interesting and valuable to my journey as a data analyst/scientist.

1. Fraud Detection: A group project for my Data Science Class. Utilizing H2O, we managed to get 0.48 on F1-Score using Gradient Boosting to predict fraud.
